These scripts allows you to get the sum in dollars of all the orders you've made (per one page of orders) on either amazon.ca or amazon.com.

## How to use it
Choose the script applicable to the site you will visit (.ca or .com). Go on amazon.ca/com and make sure the site is in english. Then go on the page where you can view your orders. It should look something like: 
 ```
 https://www.amazon.ca/gp/your-account/order-history?...
 ```
Then open the developer console (you should use Chrome or Firefox for this), and copy paste the script directly into the console.  You should then see the sum of all the order prices of the page as a console output.
